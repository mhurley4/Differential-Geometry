# Differential-Geometry

The curvatures.py file contains several functions, each of which takes as input a parameterization x and parameters u, v, to compute tangent vectors, a unit normal vector, first and second fundamental forms, Gaussian and mean curvatures, the matrix form of the differential of the Gauss map, and principal curvatures.
   
Compute_Curvatures.ipnyb is a Jupyter notebook that can be used to implement functions in curvatures.py.
It imports curvatures.py and then uses functions from there.
Currently computes curvatures for three parameterizations (two for a helicoid and one for a sphere).

Homework_11 contains code for homework 11.
