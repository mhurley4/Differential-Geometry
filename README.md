# Differential-Geometry

The curvatures.py file contains several functions, each of which takes an input a parameterization x and parameters u, v, to compute tangent vectors, unit normal vector, first and second fundamental forms, Gaussian and mean curvatures, matrix form of the differential of the Gauss map, and principal curvatures.
   
Compute_Curvatures.ipnyb is a Jupyter notebook that can be used to implement functions in curvatures.py.
It imports curvatures.py and then uses functions from there.
Currently computes curvatures for three surfaces (two helicoids and sphere).
